Introduction
=======================

**SERVO CAM** is an open-source DIY project that allows you to quickly build a ready-made, working structure consisting of servos and a camera placed on a servo-controlled platform. Project allows remote and local control of the whole using specially prepared software. It also allows for automatic control by means of the possibility of connecting artificial intelligence models.

The project consists of a ready scheme of building the whole from the hardware side and a software part in the form of specially prepared software that allows you to start, control and manage the machine. The design also allows for quick connection of custom actions to an external device and their remote activation, as well as for communication from the remote device to the controlling computer in order to send e.g. status data. Communication with the mechanism can take place locally, via USB, or remotely via LAN or WLAN (WiFi).

The structure can be built from ready-made elements and can consist of a mechanism of any power, the control software allows you to operate any servo (with a tilt angle of up to 180 degrees) and any camera (USB, HDMI, CSI). The project includes a full diagram of an example device that can be quickly built using commonly available components, along with descriptions of steps, photos and links to an example store. The whole is based on widely available, programmable platforms such as Arduino and Raspberry - the project includes a code to be uploaded to the device and a connection diagram.

Both the assembly instruction and the software are available under an open source license - anyone can modify the whole for their own needs and enrich the structure with their own functions and behaviors.
